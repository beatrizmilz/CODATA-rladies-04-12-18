**[Gabriela de Queiroz](https://github.com/gdequeiroz)** founded R-Ladies on **October 1, 2012**. She wanted to give back to the community after going to several meetups and learning a lot for free.  The first meetup was placed in **San Francisco, California (United States)**. In the following years more R-Ladies chapters started around the globe.
